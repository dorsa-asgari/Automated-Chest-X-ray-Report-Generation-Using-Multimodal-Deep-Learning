### Automated Chest X-ray Report Generation Using Multimodal Deep Learning
 
- Implemented a multimodal encoder-decoder framework for automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray images.
- Utilized a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the visual encoder and GPT-2 as the language decoder, incorporating a cross-attention mechanism to fuse image features with textual content.
- Achieved strong performance with the ViT-GPT2 architecture, as measured by standard NLP metrics: BLEU-1 (0.7231), BLEU-2 (0.6369), BLEU-3 (0.5694), BLEU-4 (0.5119), and ROUGE-L (0.6954).
